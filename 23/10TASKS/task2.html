        Lorem <mark>ipsum</mark>, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
        The passage is attributed to an <span class="ya" >typesetter</span> in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of
        Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur <span class="ya" >adipiscing</span> elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
        magna aliqua.”
        The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that
        doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler
        text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
