    <div class="y">The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their
        dry-transfer
        sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all
        around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the
        authoritative history of lorem ipsum.</div>

    <div class="y">Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin,
        though it
        looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’
        loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty
        real.”

        As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”</div>

    <div class="y">The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
        elit”, looks
        like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

        Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind
        the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum,</div>

    <div id="ov">
        So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely
        scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type
        specimen book.

        It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the
        1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type
        samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th
        century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.</p>

    <div class="y">In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections
        1.10.32–33 of
        Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:

        “Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non
        numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.”</div>

    <div class="y">A 1914 English translation by Harris Rackham reads:

        “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
        occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.”
        McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts of lorem ipsum's origin, however, the “how
        and when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing theories and timelines.</div>
