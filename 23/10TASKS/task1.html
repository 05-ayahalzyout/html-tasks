            <b> Inlain CSS</b>Knowing whether to write “vs.” or “vs” as an abbreviation can come in handy, whether
            you’re
            talking about a sports match, a legal case, or any other contest. Proper use of abbreviations is important
            because it helps people communicate clearly and using an abbreviation incorrectly can negatively affect how
            others view your writing. These guidelines will help you know which versus abbreviation to use in various

    <p id="image">Perhaps the greatest example we mention in this subject, when our beloved Prophet – peace be upon him
        – was
        forced to leave his dear homeland Mecca, when he came out he was very sad and said: “you are my beloved country,
        and I will love you, and if your people did not force me to leave you, I would never leave you” ; the words of
        our holy Prophet show us the duty of love, which must be planted in the heart of every person towards his
        homeland, whether he is young or oldI traveled with my family to one of the European countries, because my
        father used to work in this country. There I felt lonely. It is a cruel feeling, there are no friends and you
        cannot communicate with others. I longed a lot for my country, my friends and relatives. I missed our home and
        my school. I missed everything in home. Therefore, I asked my father to return to our homeland as soon as
        possible. .</p>
