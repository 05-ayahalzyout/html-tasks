        <p>Sometimes beginning with an accumulation of gas-rich magma (molten underground rock) in reservoirs near Earthâ€™s surface, <a href="https://learnenglish.nu/english-learning-language.php?english-learning=1768"target="_blank">preceded</a> 
           they can be preceded by emissions of steam and gas from small vents in the ground. Swarms of small earthquakes, which may be caused by a rising plug of dense,<a href="https://learnenglish.nu/english-learning-language.php?english-learning=1768"target="_blank"> viscous</a> magma oscillating against a sheath of more-permeable magma, may also signal volcanic eruptions, especially explosive ones. In some cases, magma rises in conduits to the surface as a thin and fluid lava,<a href="https://learnenglish.nu/english-learning-language.php?english-learning=1768"target="_blank"> either</a> flowing out continuously or shooting straight up in glowing fountains or curtains. In other cases, entrapped gases tear the magma into shreds and hurl viscous clots of lava into the air. In more violent eruptions, the magma conduit is cored out by an explosive blast, and solid fragments are ejected in a great cloud of ash-laden gas that rises tens of thousands of metres into the air<a href="https://learnenglish.nu/english-learning-language.php?english-learning=1768"target="_blank"> air</a>.
